# Hoisting in JavaScript

This project demonstrates the concept of hoisting in JavaScript through various examples. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.

## Introduction

Hoisting allows you to use variables and functions before they are declared in the code. This behavior can lead to unexpected results if not understood properly. This project includes examples and explanations to illustrate how hoisting works for variables declared with `var`, and function declarations versus function expressions.

## Examples

### 1. Variable Hoisting with `var`

```javascript
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a = 5;
```

**Explanation**: 
- Variable declarations are hoisted to the top, but initializations are not. Hence, `a` is declared but initialized to `undefined` until the assignment `a = 5` is reached.

### 2. Block-scoped Variables with `let` and `const`

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
let b = 10;
```

**Explanation**: 
- `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted, but they remain uninitialized until their declaration is processed. This results in a `ReferenceError` if accessed before declaration.

### 3. Function Hoisting

```javascript
hoistedFunction(); // Output: "I am a hoisted function"

function hoistedFunction() {
  console.log("I am a hoisted function");
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- Function declarations are hoisted completely, including their definition. Thus, you can call the function before its declaration in the code.

### 4. Function Expressions and Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(hoistedFunctionExpression); // Output: undefined
hoistedFunctionExpression(); // TypeError: hoistedFunctionExpression is not a function

var hoistedFunctionExpression = function() {
  console.log("I am a function expression");
};
```

**Explanation**: 
- While the variable `hoistedFunctionExpression` is hoisted, the function assignment is not. Therefore, trying to call it before the assignment results in an error.

## Notes

1. **Variable Hoisting (`var`)**: Declarations are moved to the top, but initializations are not.
2. **Block-scoped Hoisting (`let` and `const`)**: Variables are hoisted but are in a temporal dead zone until declared.
3. **Function Hoisting**: Function declarations are fully hoisted, while function expressions are treated like variables.
4. **Error Handling**: Accessing variables or functions before their initialization can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
